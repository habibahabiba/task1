First Task :
Write an algorithm that read a sentence, which ends with a point,, character by character to determine:

The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
The number of vowels in the sentence.
You have to keep in mind that:

Each character will be treated separately.

The last character is the point.

Use three variables as counters.
